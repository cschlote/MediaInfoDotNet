Installation Instructions
----------------------------

WINDOWS:
Ensure that MediaInfo.dll exists in your application's bin folder under either
\bin\x86\MediaInfo.dll or \bin\x64\MediaInfo.dll depending upon the bitness of 
your application. This should happen automatically on build simply by 
installing the MediaInfoDotNet package to your project.

LINUX:
The MediaInfo library must be installed into your library search paths for MediaInfoDotNet
to work. The easiest way to do this is with apt-get (or similar installer). Ex:

> apt-get install mediainfo
(https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo/Download)

Once installed, you will need to ensure that the file libmediainfo.so exists in your
library search paths. 

> ldconfig -p | grep mediainfo  
# libmediainfo.so.0 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmediainfo.so.0

"libmediainfo.so.0 is displayed not libmediainfo.so..."
As of this writing, Ubuntu's package includes a file libmediainfo.so.0.0.0 and 
libmediainfo.so.0 (the latter is just symlinked to the former). Additional work 
will need to be done in order for .Net to locate the library. We need to create
one more symlink using the naming scheme that .Net is looking for. 

Important: be sure to update below command using the paths specific to your environment.

> ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmediainfo.so.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmediainfo.so
> ldconfig

Thats it!
